## Overview

The number #1 reason for students failing this course is falling behind. In this class I have
released 100% of the schedule on day 1 so you can know what is coming due at any point in the
semester.  To that end we are going to do a quick scavenger hunt. This will probably be the easiest
scavenger hunt in history as I will tell you exactly where to look and what to do. The purpose of
this lab is to ensure that you are aware of when everything is due, familiarize yourself with the
course, and make sure you have all the development tools installed and ready to use.

## Task 1 - Install VSCode

In this task we will get all of our development tools setup on our machine. If you have a computer
that is not capable of installing all the required tools the department provides a [computer lab]({%
link _cs2/docs/syllabus.md %}#computer-lab) for all students to use.

- Install the VScode [Coding pack for Java](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/educators/installers)
- Install the [Gradle extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-gradle)

## Task 2 - Scavenger hunt

We will be using github to submit all our code. The starter code is linked below, click on the
starter code link to get access to the assignment. Once you have accepted the assignment you should
see a file named **Scavenger.java**. Your task is to replace all the `TODO` place holders with the
correct information.
